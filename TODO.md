# TODO:

Make a 'human_mode' option for sidequest/trainer battles
this will add sleeps to every action so the speed isnt so insane, might decrease the bannability

Turn all the loose pokemon_finding functions into class methods of Encounter

Keep an error log, so I can log errors
Keep a log for each mode, saving interesting information (pokemon encountered, sidequest battles consecutive wins, logging which team it lost against etc..)

Possibly extra big feature: MarketAssesment
categorize prizes and bids for each pokemon, and based off of that information find cheap pokemon/items

Calculate how fast the current enemy can kill the current pokemon, dont recurse any further than that

Fix dark on metallic damage calculation error
