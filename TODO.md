# TODO:

Fix the bug in attack() by saving the damage each move is supposed to do, to compare against
Add an optional config key for 'catch' mode, unobtained_only
- If set, skips everything that has already been captured
Check for and return the level of the encounter, to possible change the target_range based off of that (level 10-20's dont need an ultra ball)

Possibly extra big feature: MarketAssesment
categorize prizes and bids for each pokemon, and based off of that information find cheap pokemon/items
